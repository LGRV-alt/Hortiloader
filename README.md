# Hortiloader

Hortiloader is a "whiteboard" webapp built to replace a physical whiteboard within a logistics setting. 

Individual accounts can be set up and multiple users can be logged in at the same time, this allows for multiple changes/new orders to be added and updated in real-time to insure that all users have the most recent data. 

## Build
The website was created using Vite and React with the backend data coming from pocketbase.
